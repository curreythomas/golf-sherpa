### Book Tee Time
As a golfer I would like to book a tee time by viewing a golf course and selecting my tee time from a list of tee times (API) so that I can enjoy an exilerating round of golf.

#### Workflow
User views list of courses (UI: /courses)
User selects a course from the list of courses which navigates them to the view page for the selected course (UI: /courses/id)
User elects to add a tee time for that course by selecting the FAB button. User is directed to the add tee time page (UI: courses/id/teetimes/add)
